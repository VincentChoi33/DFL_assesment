# Technical Decisions and Implementation Rationale

This document explains the key technical decisions made during the implementation of the ROS 2 Image Processor project and the rationale behind each choice.

## 1. Processing Task Selection: Semantic Segmentation

### Decision
Implemented **semantic segmentation** using Mask2Former instead of object tracking or depth estimation.

### Rationale
- **State-of-the-art Performance**: Mask2Former is a recent, highly accurate segmentation model
- **Comprehensive Scene Understanding**: Provides pixel-level classification for 19 different object classes
- **Production Ready**: Well-maintained Hugging Face implementation with good documentation
- **GPU Acceleration**: Full CUDA support for real-time processing
- **Extensibility**: Easy to switch to different models or add additional processing tasks

### Alternative Considered
- **Object Tracking**: Would require additional tracking algorithms (SORT, DeepSORT) and motion path visualization
- **Depth Estimation**: Would need stereo matching algorithms and depth map processing

## 2. Image Stitching Method: Homography-based vs Side-by-side

### Decision
Implemented **both methods** with homography-based stitching as primary and side-by-side as fallback.

### Rationale
- **Homography-based**: Better for overlapping camera views, creates seamless panoramic images
- **Side-by-side**: Simple, fast, preserves all image information, good fallback option
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose based on their camera setup and requirements
- **Robustness**: System continues working even if homography matrix is unavailable

### Implementation Details
```python
def stitch_images(self, left_img, right_img):
    if self.stitching_method == 'homography' and self.homography_matrix is not None:
        return stitch_image_pair_homography(left_img, right_img, self.homography_matrix)
    else:
        return stitch_images_side_by_side(left_img, right_img)
```

## 3. Threading Model: Thread-safe Image Buffers

### Decision
Used **threading.Lock()** for image buffers instead of single-threaded processing or queue-based approach.

### Rationale
- **Concurrent Processing**: Allows simultaneous reception of left and right camera streams
- **Memory Efficiency**: Direct image storage without additional queue overhead
- **Timestamp Matching**: Enables precise synchronization of image pairs
- **Simple Implementation**: Easier to debug and maintain than complex queue systems

### Implementation
```python
self.left_image_lock = threading.Lock()
self.right_image_lock = threading.Lock()

with self.left_image_lock:
    self.left_images[timestamp] = cv_image
```

## 4. Docker Architecture: Separate CPU/GPU Images

### Decision
Created **separate Dockerfiles** for CPU and GPU versions instead of a single multi-stage build.

### Rationale
- **Clear Separation**: Users can choose appropriate version based on hardware
- **Smaller Images**: CPU version doesn't include CUDA dependencies (~2GB smaller)
- **Faster Builds**: No need to download CUDA packages for CPU-only usage
- **Easier Debugging**: Clear distinction between CPU and GPU issues

### Implementation
- `Dockerfile`: CPU version with PyTorch CPU
- `Dockerfile.gpu`: GPU version with PyTorch CUDA
- Separate docker-compose files for each version

## 5. Performance Optimization: Configurable Processing Rate

### Decision
Implemented **configurable processing rate** (100 FPS timer) instead of processing every frame.

### Rationale
- **Resource Management**: Prevents overwhelming the system with too many frames
- **Quality vs Speed**: Allows users to balance processing quality with speed
- **GPU Memory**: Prevents GPU memory overflow with large models
- **Real-time Constraints**: Ensures consistent performance under varying loads

### Implementation
```python
self.timer = self.create_timer(0.01, self.process_and_save)  # 100 FPS
```

## 6. Error Handling Strategy: Graceful Degradation

### Decision
Implemented **graceful degradation** instead of strict error handling that stops processing.

### Rationale
- **Robustness**: System continues working even if some components fail
- **User Experience**: Better than complete system failure
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify issues without system crashes
- **Production Ready**: Handles real-world scenarios where cameras may fail

### Implementation
```python
try:
    segmentation_map, color_mask = self.segmentation.segment_image(stitched_image)
except Exception as e:
    self.get_logger().warn(f'Failed to apply segmentation: {e}')
    # Continue processing without segmentation
```

## 7. Data Management: Automatic Cleanup

### Decision
Implemented **automatic image buffer cleanup** instead of unlimited storage.

### Rationale
- **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks during long-running sessions
- **Performance**: Keeps processing fast by limiting buffer size
- **Real-time Operation**: Maintains consistent performance over time
- **Resource Efficiency**: Suitable for embedded systems with limited memory

### Implementation
```python
if len(self.left_images) > 100:
    oldest_timestamp = min(self.left_images.keys())
    del self.left_images[oldest_timestamp]
```

## 8. Model Loading Strategy: Lazy Loading

### Decision
Used **lazy loading** for the Mask2Former model instead of pre-loading at startup.

### Rationale
- **Faster Startup**: System starts immediately without waiting for model download
- **Conditional Loading**: Only loads model if segmentation is enabled
- **Resource Efficiency**: Doesn't consume GPU memory if not needed
- **User Control**: Users can disable segmentation to save resources

### Implementation
```python
if self.enable_segmentation:
    try:
        self.segmentation = SemanticSegmentation()
    except Exception as e:
        self.get_logger().warn(f'Failed to initialize semantic segmentation: {e}')
        self.enable_segmentation = False
```

## 9. File Organization: Modular Package Structure

### Decision
Used **standard ROS 2 package structure** instead of a monolithic script.

### Rationale
- **ROS 2 Best Practices**: Follows official ROS 2 conventions
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new nodes or modify existing ones
- **Deployment**: Standard structure for ROS 2 deployment tools

### Structure
```
ros2_image_processor/
├── ros2_image_processor/
│   ├── image_processor_node.py  # Main node
│   ├── seg.py                   # Segmentation module
│   └── stitching_utils.py       # Stitching utilities
├── launch/                      # Launch files
├── config/                      # Configuration files
└── package.xml                  # Package metadata
```

## 10. Deployment Strategy: Docker + Scripts

### Decision
Provided **both Docker Compose and shell scripts** for deployment.

### Rationale
- **Docker Compose**: Standard, reproducible deployment for production
- **Shell Scripts**: Easier for development and debugging
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose based on their workflow
- **Automation**: Scripts handle the complete setup process

### Benefits
- **Reproducibility**: Same environment across different machines
- **Isolation**: No conflicts with system dependencies
- **Portability**: Works on any system with Docker
- **Automation**: Reduces manual setup steps

## 11. Data Download Strategy: Conditional Download

### Decision
Implemented **conditional download** of the rosbag2 file instead of requiring manual download.

### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Reduces setup friction
- **Automation**: Integrates seamlessly with start scripts
- **Robustness**: Handles missing data gracefully
- **Efficiency**: Only downloads when needed

### Implementation
```bash
if [ ! -d "rosbag2_2025_06_16-15_16_29" ] || [ ! -f "rosbag2_2025_06_16-15_16_29/rosbag2_2025_06_16-15_16_29_0.db3" ]; then
    ./download_rosbag.sh
fi
```

## 12. Visualization Strategy: Multiple Output Formats

### Decision
Implemented **multiple output formats**: ROS topics, saved images, and real-time viewing.

### Rationale
- **ROS Integration**: Standard ROS 2 topic publishing for real-time viewing
- **Persistence**: Saved images for offline analysis
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred viewing method
- **Debugging**: Multiple ways to verify system operation

### Outputs
- `/processed_image`: Real-time stitched image topic
- `/segmented_image`: Real-time segmented image topic
- `visualization_output/stitched/`: Saved stitched images
- `visualization_output/segmented/`: Saved segmented images

## Summary

These technical decisions were made with the following priorities in mind:

1. **Robustness**: System should handle errors gracefully and continue operating
2. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing with GPU acceleration
3. **Usability**: Easy setup and operation for users with varying technical backgrounds
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code that's easy to understand and extend
5. **Standards Compliance**: Follows ROS 2 best practices and conventions

The implementation successfully balances these requirements while providing a production-ready solution for dual camera image processing with semantic segmentation.
